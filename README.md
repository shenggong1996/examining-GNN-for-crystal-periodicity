# examining-GNN-for-crystal-periodicity

This repo is associated with the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05039 (Examining graph neural networks for crystal structures: limitations and opportunities for capturing periodicity)

This repo provides the e3nn and de-e3nn designed specifically for predicting properties of crystal structures, and also the light-weighted version of dataset for quickly reproducing the key results of the paper, as well as testing the ability of new models on capturing periodicity.

Note: 1) the complete datasets as well as the trained models of the paper are stored in https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Improving_deep_representation_learning_for_crystal_structures_by_learning_and_hybridizing_human-designed_descriptors/19654224

2) the e3nn code in this repo is a revised version of https://github.com/ninarina12/phononDoS_tutorial. Please cite both papers if you use the one provided here.
